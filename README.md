To Use:

1. Click the green "Clone or Download" button.

2. Click "Download ZIP".

3. Extract the file to a safe location.

4. Open frontpage.html to start the program.

Tabs:

1. Sign In to Visit Library - Students will sign in here when they have left another class or lunch to come here.

2. Sign Out with a Hallpass - A student leaving the library must sign out here if they aren't going back where they came.

3. Class Visit - A teacher who brings their whole class will sign in here, so we know how many students they are bringing without making each log in.

4. Attendance - Students who have an entire class in the library will log in here at the beginning of class.  If they don't, they will be marked absent.

5. Librarian Only - A password-protected menu with buttons to export data either as its own Excel file or appended to an existing file, a drop-down menu to change the bell schedule, and therefore when Attendance students are considered tardy, a button to sign out all visitors, and a button to lock the menu again.  While the menu is open, there are X buttons in the other tabs next to each student's entry.  Clicking a button will permanently remove the entry it's next to.
